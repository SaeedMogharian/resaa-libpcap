Libpcap is an open source C library that provides an API for capturing packets directly from the datalink layer of Unix derived operating systems. It is used by popular packet capture applications such as tcpdump and snort that enables them to run on just about any flavor of Unix.

DevDungeonUsing libpcap in Clibpcap allows us to capture or send packets from a live network device or a file. This tutorial and code examples will walk you through using libpcap to find network devices, get information about devices, process packets in real time or offline, send packets, and even listen to wireless traffic.
